# Solvers

Solvers are at the core of the optimization routines.
To perform a seismic inversion you will need a solver with forward and adjoint capabilities.

### 3D Solvers

#### SPECFEM3D

SPECFEM3D Cartesian simulates acoustic (fluid), elastic (solid), coupled acoustic/elastic, poroelastic or seismic wave propagation in any type of conforming mesh of hexahedra (structured or not.) It can, for instance, model seismic waves propagating in sedimentary basins or any other regional geological model following earthquakes. It can also be used for non-destructive testing or for ocean acoustics.

The main resource is [SPECFEM3D website](http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/).

#### SPECFEM3D GLOBE

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE simulates global and regional (continental-scale) seismic wave propagation.

### 2D Solvers

#### SPECFEM2D

SPECFEM2D simulates forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation in two-dimensional acoustic, (an)elastic, poroelastic or coupled acoustic-(an)elastic-poroelastic media, with Convolution PML absorbing conditions.
